# Languages

[Visit the table of contents](README.md)

The active selection is a Python class named `Language`. This class is
designed to interact with a JSON file named `language_codes.json`, which
presumably contains a list of languages and their corresponding codes.

In the `__init__` method of the `Language` class, the
`language_codes.json` file is opened and its contents are loaded into
the `self.languages` attribute. This is done using the `open` function
and the `load` function from the `json` module. The `open` function is
used to open the file and the `load` function is used to deserialize the
JSON document to a Python object.

The `get_language_codes` method of the `Language` class returns a list
of all language codes in the `self.languages` attribute. It creates an
empty list, iterates over the `self.languages` attribute, and appends
each language code to the list using the `append` method. Finally, it
returns the list.

The `get_language_name` method of the `Language` class returns the name
of a language given its code. It iterates over the `self.languages`
attribute and returns the name of the language when it finds a match for
the given code. If no match is found, it returns `None`.

This class can be useful in projects where you need to work with
different languages and their codes. For example, you might use it in a
language translation application, a multilingual website, or a language
learning app.
